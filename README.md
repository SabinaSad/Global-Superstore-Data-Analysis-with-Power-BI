## Project Overview

Welcome to my journey through the Global Superstore dataset!
Here,  I delve deep into the data, extracting valuable insights and uncovering trends. My aim is to provide analyses that are easy to understand, aiding in making informed decisions and driving success.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

I've ensured that the data is clean and ready for analysis using the Power Query Editor. In this step, I cleaned and filtered the data, making it primed for visualization.
